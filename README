Yadda

Yet Another Dashboard designed for certain development setup. Originally
designed for the Mercurial community. It may be interesting if your setup has
some of the following properties:

  - Community review - no specific reviewer
  - Reviewer push - author cannot push
  - 2-Pass review - use blocking reviewers and non-blocking
  - Dependent patches - dependent patch series is common
  - Bounded "open" revisions - it's sane to enumerate all open revisions
